# project2-programming-data-analysis  

This repository is part of the module of the same name of the HDip in Data Analysis of ATU Galway and contains the second project.  
***
## Content
The repository consists of a git.ignore file, a readme and a jupyter notebook file with the code and explanation of the project.  
This readme lists the contents of the notebook file, the procedures it contains and a brief description of the file.

## Problem statement
1. Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
2. Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
3. Examine Irish context:
   Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change 
   signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect)
4. Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas 
   dataframe and export to csv and json formats
5. For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between 
   them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).
6. Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to 
   published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
7. Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage)

## Instructions  

The following instructions are to clone and run any code or notebook contained in this repository.  

### **Cloning the Repository**:  

1. Install Git: Install Git on your system. You can download from here:  
https://git-scm.com/downloads  

   If you already have Git installed, you can get the latest development version via Git itself:

   "git clone https://github.com/git/git"

   You can also always browse the current contents of the git repository using the web interface.

2. Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Open the terminal or command prompt on your system.

3. Navigate to the Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
 
   "cd path/to/destination/folder"
5. Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone it:

   "git clone repository_url.git"
   
   Replace repository_url.git with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.

   https://github.com/jalaca91/project2-programming-data-analysis.git

   This is the URL for this repository


### **Running Code/Notebooks**: 

**For Code**:
1. Choose the IDE/Editor: Depending on the programming language, select an appropriate IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm,, etc.).
2. Open the Project: Open the cloned repository in your chosen IDE/Editor.

**For Notebooks**:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook/Lab: If not installed, install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can do this via pip:

   pip install jupyterlab

   If you have installed anaconda,is already included in the system by default.  

2. Navigate to the Notebook: In your terminal, navigate to the directory where the notebook is located.

3. Start Jupyter: Type jupyter notebook or jupyter lab in the terminal and press Enter. This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser.
4. Access the Notebook: Use the browser interface to locate and open the notebook file with the ipynb extension.
5. Run Cells: Inside the notebook, execute the code cells one by one or use the "Run All" option to run the entire notebook,which shows the in and out of all the code and markdown
   boxes that make up the notebook.
