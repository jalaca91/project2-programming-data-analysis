    "\n",
    "The theme of the project is a brief analysis and review of a study presented in 2008 in the journal Nature in 2008 [1]. This study analyzed Antarctic ice cores to reconstruct past atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lüthi and his team used ice cores to examine how CO2 levels have varied over hundreds of thousands of years.  \n",
    "Their findings revealed a significant relationship between changes in CO2 levels and temperature variations over past climate periods.  \n",
    "They showed that changes in CO2 levels were closely related to changes in global temperature, supporting the idea that CO2 is an important driver of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study provided valuable insight into how CO2 levels have fluctuated over Earth's history and how these changes have influenced climatic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have increased since the industrial revolution (i.e., since the mid-1700s) and, by the 1950s, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 had risen from 284 parts per million (ppm) to 300 ppm above pre-industrial levels, the highest level in at least 800,000 years (Luthi et al., 2008).[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study there were several limitations, such as the availability or accuracy of the data, since it covers a period of tens of thousands of years, but a series of conclusions were drawn that are intended to be replicated in the present project.\n"
